# Stack
For this experement I will be testing the pros and cons of implementing a stack with either Arrays, Singly Linked Lists, or Vectors.

# Testing
In this project I will be testing the speed difference on a few different platforms between Arrays, Vectors, and Singly Linked Lists. There will be three operations done.

Three data types will be tested: `int`, `double`, and `string`. These were chosen due to them being in the C++ standard library and their increasing complexity from left to right. Integers are rather simple, doubles are more complex but


## Append 
A value will be added to the end of the structure.
## Iteration
There will be a loop that will attept to get every value. 

## Pop
Will delete the last value.
